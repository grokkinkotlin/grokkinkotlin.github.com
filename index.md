Hey there, thanks for visiting my latest learning-blog.

I'm a Java developer with a bunch of experience in Groovy, [Ruby](https://rubyeyeforthejavaguy.blogspot.com/), [Scala](https://scalaeyeforthejavaguy.blogspot.com/), Haskell, and Javascript. 

I like to learn new languages which take me out of my comfort zone.  I've never done any system-level programming; hence my attempt at Grokkin' Kotlin.

I learn best by blogging as I go (it's my version of [the Feynman Technique](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1076294048837758977) - which worked with me and [Algebra](https://andrewharmellaw.github.io), and is currently working with [GoLang](https://grokkinggolang.github.io) so he's onto something).  That means, whilst you _might_ find what I post useful, this _probably isn't_ the best place to visit if you're looking for startling insight.

However, if you do choose to stick around, I hope you find something that's useful to you.  And if you have any comments, I'll be switching on [Disqus](http://Disqus.com) integration as soon as I get round to it.
